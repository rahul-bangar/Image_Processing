# Brain Tumor Detection through Image Processing

 The objective of the project is to detect, outline and compute the area and perimeter of brain tumors in different MRI images.
 It is necessary to point out that MRI images can be very different from each other depending on the type of MRI (T1,T2,FLAIR,...).
 Thus the images have been selected from a dataset containing images acquired with the same technique.
 In the case of MRI images without tumors, a simple message “No tumor detected” will be displayed.
